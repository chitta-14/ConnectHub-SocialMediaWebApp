3. Posts: Users can create and publish posts, share updates, and express themselves through text and multimedia content.
4. Comments and Likes: Interactive features such as commenting and liking enable users to engage with each other's posts and foster discussions.
5. Friend Connections: Users can send and accept friend requests, expanding their network and staying connected with friends and acquaintances.
6. News Feed: A dynamic news feed displays posts from friends and followed pages, keeping users updated with relevant content.
7. Search and Discovery: Robust search functionality allows users to find friends, pages, and groups, enhancing their overall experience.

Technologies Used:
--> Backend: Spring Boot for building the backend logic and RESTful APIs.
